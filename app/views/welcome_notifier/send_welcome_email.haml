  %a{:href => root_url + 'u/' + @user.url} Your pledge
  is a huge step forward! Keep this momentum going. Get started on your hours for the week with the recommended actions below.
  %br
  %br

.p
  1.
  %a{:href => root_url(:ref_user => @user.url)} Make your own pledge
  and get a meeting with
  =@user.name.split[0].capitalize
  on the books. You'll be much more effective once you are organized and your commitment is clear.
.p
  2. Spread the Word: It doesn't make sense to spend hours thinking about politics unless you are going to take action.
  %a{:href => root_url + 'u/' + @user.url} Share pledges
  on Facebook, Twitter, etc. Finally, a post that will lead to effective action. Tag your most politically engaged friends, and tell everyone to do the same.
.p
  3.
  %a{ href: "https://thesixtyfive.org/home", title: "" } Call your representatives
  about the issues you care about. Itâ€™s one of the most
  %a{ href: "http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/contacting-your-congressional-representative_us_582a0965e4b060adb56f8e95", title: "" } effective actions
  you can take.
